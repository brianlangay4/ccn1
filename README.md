NOTE: these is only instaraction for the model created deeper explanation about the Convolutional neural network will be provided in our Article is avalable in this link: http://langaytm.com/convolution-neural-network/. in this repo will be updating the information as we keep on updating the works and advancement of the model

Instructions 
in this model there sevel packages used that needds to be imported before excution will name the important packages and how to install it
1. tensorflow // pip install tensorlow 
2. opencv // pip install opencv-python
3. Keras // pip instal keras
4. pickles // pip install pickles
5. matplotlib and numpy // pip install matplotlib // pip install numpy 
numpy will be automatically installed in tensorflow installation no need to install again

now lets get startedwith the code 
import the packages you can import them as same 
here is explanation about important imports the other packages we can directly 9those ause after import as usual and the explanation and reason is straight forward

now for layers used in the model we import them from the keras so we have to make sure we import every layars uedd in the model ihave listed all in a single line 10 as the well as model in the line 

those are the all important things we need to pay attention to the use of the this model

now lets get startedwith the code its self 
part 1
first impontant thing in beulding the neural networks models is the dataset it self these is what we feed to our NN to learn from thse data set

in these model i have used the cat and dogs data set is avalable in kaggle after downloading thsese dataset then you can start using them in the code as follows

so inoder to import these data into the project first step is create a structure for it in a propermanner
we have created a string that holds the pah to our dataset file
in line 14 then the list contain the folder names we gave it corresponding to ourdataset in the following line 

now we can start importing the data as follows
